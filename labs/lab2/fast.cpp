/**
 * Class that stores a summary of an image.
 *
 * This summary is intended to contain a high-level representation of the
 * important parts of an image. I.e. it shall contain what a human eye would
 * find relevant, while ignoring things that the human eye would find
 * irrelevant.
 *
 * To approximate human perception, we store a series of booleans that indicate
 * if the brightness of the image has increased or not. We do this for all
 * horizontal lines and vertical lines in a downsampled version of the image.
 *
 * See the lab instructions for more details.
 *
 * Note: You will need to use this data structure as the key in a hash table. As
 * such, you will need to implement equality checks and a hash function for this
 * data structure.
